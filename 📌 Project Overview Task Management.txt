📌 Project Overview: Task Management App (Trello Clone)
This project is a full-stack task management application where users can create boards, lists, and tasks (similar to Trello). It will be built using React + TypeScript for the frontend, Express (Node.js) or FastAPI (Python) for the backend, PostgreSQL or MySQL for the database, and Docker to containerize everything.

🛠️ Features:
✅ User authentication (JWT-based)
✅ Create & manage boards, lists, and tasks
✅ Drag-and-drop tasks between lists
✅ Task assignment & due dates
✅ Comments & activity tracking
✅ Real-time updates (WebSockets or polling)
✅ API-first design (so a mobile app could be built in the future)
✅ Dockerized deployment
